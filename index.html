        <h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How has the proportion of investor purchases in Boston changed over
            time, and do any trends emerge around fluctuations in the economy?
            <br />
            <br />
            The reading, "Homes for Profit: An Analysis of Investor Activity in
            the Greater Boston Residential Real Estate Market, 2000 - 2022",
            discusses that investor purchases surged during periods of recession
            when housing prices were relatively lower, so I hope to explore
            whether the activity of investors can be visualized according to
            trends in economic fluctation.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            Where in Boston has investor activity been most concentrated, and
            how does it affect neighborhood demographics and housing
            affordability?
            <br />
            <br />
            I had assumed investor activity would be primarily in high-end
            apartments before reading "Homes for Profit: An Analysis of Investor
            Activity in the Greater Boston Residential Real Estate Market, 2000
            - 2022", where I learned the most investor activity occurs in high
            density, low housing price submarkets, so I'm interested in how
            investor purchases heighten displacement pressures and change
            neighborhood demographics.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            What patterns emerge in the frequency, location, and profitability
            of flipped properties in Boston, and do they suggest new trends in
            housing speculation?
            <br />
            <br />
            Identifying emerging hotspots for flips and their profitability
            could provide valuable insights for policymakers, housing advocates,
            and prospective homebuyers trying to navigate Boston’s competitive
            market.

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

            This chart explores the average price of a property sold between
            2000 and 2022 for each property type. It demonstrates that
            commercial buildings and properties designated as exempt from zoning
            codes (such as those used for public functions) were bought for
            significantly higher prices than all other property types. The chart
            also shows the price range that properties are usually sold for,
            with family residences ranging from 500,000 to over a million
            dollars, to commercial properties that cost more than ten million on
            average. Finally, through the creation of this figure, it was
            revealed that the dataset had no data for property type codes of OTH
            or R25, so these two property types were filtered out.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="a2.2.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This chart displays the amount of property sold per year from 2000
            to 2022 for each property type. All types sold under 100 properties
            per year besides Residential Clusters, which comprised the
            overwhelming majority of property sales ranging from 1500 to 3000
            properties, and required a separate scale of larger magnitude to
            visualize. Each chart also depicts a distinct trough in properties
            sold during 2020 compared to neighboring years, likely due to
            pandemic restrictions and the accompanying economic downturn.

            The two heatmaps compare the location and densities of investor
            property purchases and non-investor property purchases in Boston
            from 2000 to 2022. Investor property purchases are clustered much
            more tightly around the metro Boston area, whereas non-investor
            property purchases are dispersed further throughout the suburbs and
            Suffolk County. However, the locations of densest property purchases
            (areas highlighted in yellow) for both investor and non-investors
            overlap.
