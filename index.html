        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How has the proportion of investor purchases in Boston changed over
            time, and do any trends emerge around fluctuations in the economy?
            <br />
            <br />
            By analyzing residential sales data from 2000 to 2023, we can
            investigate how closely investor activity aligns with broader
            economic cycles like the 2008 financial crisis, the post-recession
            recovery, and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
            Visualizing these patterns over time can reveal whether investor
            activity accelerates primarily during downturns, periods of rapid
            appreciation, or both. Additionally, identifying long-term
            trends—such as whether investor purchases have become a more
            permanent fixture of Boston’s housing market—can help policymakers
            and housing advocates gauge the extent to which speculative
            investment has reshaped homeownership opportunities and neighborhood
            stability.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            Where in Boston has investor activity been most concentrated, and
            how does it affect neighborhood demographics and housing
            affordability?
            <br />
            <br />
            From my own personal experience of witnessing a surge of luxury
            apartment and high end office space construction sites, I had
            assumed investor activity would be primarily in the expensive
            property submarkets. However, after reading "Homes for Profit: An
            Analysis of Investor Activity in the Greater Boston Residential Real
            Estate Market, 2000 - 2022", I learned that most investor activity
            occurs in high density, low housing price submarkets, which is not
            just a reflection of market forces, but also actively reshapes who
            can afford to live in these neighborhoods and the long-term
            stability of these communities. Mapping investor purchases across
            Boston’s neighborhoods will allow us to see how closely investment
            patterns align with areas already vulnerable to displacement, which
            is essential for understanding patterns of displacement,
            gentrification, and the widening racial and economic disparities in
            homeownership..<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            What patterns emerge in the frequency, location, and profitability
            of flipped properties in Boston, and do they suggest new trends in
            housing speculation?
            <br />
            <br />
            The reading, "Homes for Profit: An Analysis of Investor Activity in
            the Greater Boston Residential Real Estate Market, 2000–2022",
            highlights how property flipping has become a dominant form of real
            estate investment. It's important to investigate the broader
            patterns and potential new trends in property flipping activity to
            answer questions such as whether flipping rates are accelerating in
            response to economic cycles, housing shortages, or policy changes;
            which neighborhoods are under the most speculative pressure and may
            signal early stages of gentrification; and whether the highest flip
            profits are concentrated in already expensive areas, or in more
            affordable neighborhoods where properties can be bought cheaply and
            resold at a steep markup. Identifying emerging hotspots for flips
            and their profitability could provide valuable insights for
            policymakers, housing advocates, and prospective homebuyers trying
            to navigate Boston’s competitive market.

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

        <figure>
          <img src="a2.1.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This chart explores the average price of a property sold between
            2000 and 2022 for each property type. It demonstrates that
            commercial buildings and properties designated as exempt from zoning
            codes (such as those used for public functions) were bought for
            significantly higher prices than all other property types. The chart
            also shows the price range that properties are usually sold for,
            with family residences ranging from 500,000 to over a million
            dollars, to commercial properties that cost more than ten million on
            average. Finally, through the creation of this figure, it was
            revealed that the dataset had no data for property type codes of OTH
            or R25, so these two property types were filtered out.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="a2.2.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This chart displays the amount of property sold per year from 2000
            to 2022 for each property type. All types sold under 100 properties
            per year besides Residential Clusters, which comprised the
            overwhelming majority of property sales ranging from 1500 to 3000
            properties, and required a separate scale of larger magnitude to
            visualize. Each chart also depicts a distinct trough in properties
            sold during 2020 compared to neighboring years, likely due to
            pandemic restrictions and the accompanying economic downturn.

          <figcaption>
            The two heatmaps compare the location and densities of investor
            property purchases and non-investor property purchases in Boston
            from 2000 to 2022. Investor property purchases are clustered much
            more tightly around the metro Boston area, whereas non-investor
            property purchases are dispersed further throughout the suburbs and
            Suffolk County. However, the locations of densest property purchases
            (areas highlighted in yellow) for both investor and non-investors
            overlap.

          <img src="a2.4.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            The count of flipped properties on both the buy and sell side
            mirrors the trends seen in the total amount of properties sold, with
            residential clusters representing the overwhelming majority of
            flipped properties and 1-family residences, commercial buildings,
            and apartments being next highest. This also begs the question of
            whether or not the location distribution of flipped property sales
            is similar to the Overall location distribution of all properties
            sold between 2000 to 2022.

        <figure>
          <img src="a2.5.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This figure is a density map of the locations of properties that
            were flipped. Notably, all locations are within the most
            metropolitan area of Boston - no flipped properties are located in
            the suburbs. Furthermore, the most concentrated locations are the
            same areas that experience the most overall purchase traffic.

        <figure>
          <img src="a2.6.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This figure displays the profit made by a property flip between the
            years 2000 to 2022. The vast majority of property flips made
            positive profit, and the graph highlights a few instances of extreme
            profit in 2004 and 2011. However, due to the few high outliers
            skewing the graph, it makes it difficult to determine the typical
            return of a property flip and whether the majority of property flips
            involved small profits or large ones.
          </figcaption>

        <figure>
          <img src="a2.7.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This diagram aims to resolve the question posed by the previous
            figure by visualizing what proportion of property flips lost money,
            made under $100,000, made between $100,000 and $1,000,000, or made
            over $1,000,000 each year. Some key conclusions can be drawn from
            this graph. First, the total number of property flips seem to drop
            steadily after 2013, although this could be due to more recent data
            not being properly labelled as a property flip. Another find is that
            in the early 2000s, the proportion of property flips earning between
            $0-$100,000 was approximately equal to the proportion of property
            flips earning $100,000-$1,000,000, but from 2008 and onwards, the
            majority of property flip profits were in the $100,000- $1,000,000
            range. Finally there was a significant peak in property flips that
            lost money from 2004-2009, the years in and leading up to the Great
            Recession.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          Through this exploratory data analysis of Boston’s residential sales
          data from 2000 to 2023, we’ve gained crucial insights into the
          patterns of investor activity, property flipping, and their impact on
          the city’s housing market. First, the analysis of investor purchases
          over time revealed clear alignment between investor activity and
          broader economic fluctuations. Investor purchases dipped during key
          periods of economic downturn, like the Great Recession (2008-2009) and
          the early COVID-19 pandemic, while remaining relatively stable
          throughout the 2010s, suggesting that speculative investment
          decelerates as economic uncertainty increases. Geographic analysis of
          investor activity showed that investor purchases are concentrated in
          high-density, lower-cost neighborhoods. This supports findings from
          "Homes for Profit", which emphasized investor pressure in areas
          already vulnerable to displacement. The overlap between areas with the
          densest investor purchases and those with the most non-investor
          activity suggests these neighborhoods are at the forefront of Boston’s
          affordability challenges. When examining property flipping, strong
          trends emerged in both frequency and location. Residential clusters
          made up the overwhelming majority of flipped properties, mirroring
          their dominance in total sales. Flipped properties were also tightly
          concentrated within the metro Boston area, with no significant
          flipping activity observed in suburban regions. This spatial
          concentration raises questions about the long-term stability and
          affordability of these central neighborhoods. Finally, the data
          visualizations revealed how investor-driven flipping contributes to
          market distortions. The profitability of flips often depends on
          purchasing lower-cost properties and reselling them at steep markups,
          which likely fuels rising home prices and displacement pressures in
          these areas. Identifying emerging flipping hotspots and understanding
          their profitability can help policymakers anticipate gentrification
          and take proactive steps to curb speculative investment’s negative
          impacts. Together, these findings highlight the need for stronger
          policy interventions to protect Boston’s most vulnerable communities
          from speculative investment and ensure equitable access to
          homeownership. By visualizing and understanding these trends, we take
          an essential step toward promoting long-term housing stability and
          affordability across the city.
